# ParallelTSPwithDrone

This part of my master thesis aims to formulate a simplified version of the Parallel Drone Scheduling Traveling Salesman Problem (PDSTSP) by Murray and Chu to find an approximation result to the classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
We first define all the necessary terminologies as PTSP-D tour, problem statement and delivery time to prove an approximation and lower bound result presented in the following subsections.
